Features of jenkins:
--------------------

- Whenever developers write code & pushes it to SCM, we integrate all that code of all developers at that point of time and we build, test and deliver/deploy to the client. This process is called CI & CD.
- Jenkins helps in achieving this CI / CD process.
- So in a day, there will be so many code change commits, pushes , builds, tests & deliveries/deployments.
- So bugs will be reported fast and get rectified fast. So development happens fast.


Other CI tools available in market:
----------------------------------
 GitLab, Circle CI , GitHub actions , Bamboo

Jenkins workflow :
------------------
- We attach Git, Maven, Selenium & Artifactory plugin's to Jenkins.

- as soon as Developers push code to GitHub, Jenkins pull that code instantly & sends that to Maven for build & maven will generate artifacts.

- Once build is done artifacts are generated, Jenkins pull that built artifacts and send to Junit/selenium for testing

- Once testing is done, then Jenkins will pull that build artifacts and send to artifactory to store artifacts.

- then as per clients requirement, We can either handover artiafacts to client ====>> continiuos delivery
                                                  (or) 
- we will deploy those artifacts on client servers using Jenkins ====>> continiuos deployment



Benefits of Continuous Integration:
-----------------------------------
- Since bugs will be reported fast and get rectified fast. So development happens fast.
- Maintains history (Logs) for reference


Jenkins Jobs:
-------------
sequence of tasks that userdefines is called as job in jenkins

What is Build in Jenkins:
-------------------------
running the job is called as build in jenkins


Three types of jobs are created in jenkins:
-----------------------------------------
1. Freestyle job
2. Maven Project
3. Pipeline job

1. Freestyle job:
   - free style jobs are general type build jobs. using which we can execute linux command, run shell scripts
   - used for mild customizations, such as we can combine any vcs with any build tools.

2. Maven Project
   - maven project are jobs which will run maven goals against pom.xml & generates artifacts (war/jar files).
  
3. Pipeline Jobs:
   - pipeline jobs will run entire SDLC (software developement life cycle) as a code.
  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Importnant note:
----------------
- Jenkins Homepage is also known as jenkins dashboard
- In Jenkins, J0B == PROJECT == ITEM == ALL ARE SAME
- In Jenkins, running a J0B is called as BUILD
   while running job if job succeded ==> build is success
                     if job failed ==> build is failed
					 
- Jenkins default home directory path ==> /var/lib/jenkins					
- jenkins default port number is 8080

**************Important Interview question*****************

How to create a freestyle project step by step?
==================================================
- jenkinsdashboard --> create new item --> give_any_name & select Freestyleproject --> click OK --> confuration page will gets openend
   Options in configure page:
     1. general tab --> give descirption about your job/project
	 
     2. Source Code Management 
	    in this section, we can select git option as we can use git a VCS, we can provide github repo url , branch name & credentials,
		it will checkout source code from github to jenkins workspace.
		
     3. Build triggers
	    in this section, we can trigger the job based on time / commit / once other jobs are built	        
	    i. Build periodically ==> 
		       it will trigger the job based on time, we can schedule jobs like crontab. 
        ii.poll scm ==>
		       it will trigger the job based on commit.
		       jenkins will look after SCM periodically, if there are any new commits within specified time then it will trigger the job
	    iii.Build after other projects are built ==>  
		       we can trigger build only after other project/job is built.
	 
     4. Build step:
	     it is the major step in freestyle project
	     if we select execute shell ==> we can run any shell scripts & build related commands.
	
    5. Post-build Actions:
	    these will get executed after build steps execution.
		here we can  - run test cases
                 	 - we can do deployments
               		 - email build results.

Create a sample job / Project / item
-------------------------------------------------

create new item

give a name for your job

select freestyle project & create

your build configuratin page will open

now go to build tab & select execute shell from dropdown menu

In Command Box Enter echo " Hello Jenkins"

Click on apply & save

come to jenkins dashboard & click on build now

Click on Console Output & observe logs

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Example:1
*********
echo " hi this my first Jenkins job"

cd /var/lib/jenkins/
touch file_sample1



Example:2
*********
echo " hi this my first Jenkins job"

touch file_sample2

Note:
*****
  If you haven't specific path to create file, it will create file_sample2 file in Jenkins local under job directory workspace/<job/project/>/
  
  Ex:
  /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/Sample-Project1


Example:3
*********
Add script in Remote repo and configure url in SCM session.

Make sure that Git is installed in Jenkins server, If not it will throw error while configuring git url.

Once you configured Git url then execute script by using sh <script-name>

Build step==>Execute shell==>sh script.sh

Maven:
*****
1.what is Settings.xml file in maven ?
In Maven, the settings.xml file is an essential configuration file that allows you to customize various settings 
for your Maven build environment. This file is typically located in the conf directory of your Maven installation, 
under the Maven_Home directory. Additionally, you can also have a user-specific settings.xml file in the .m2 directory in your user's home directory, 
allowing for individual user configuration.

2.What is Pom.xml file in maven?
In Maven, the pom.xml file is a Project Object Model (POM) file, and it is a fundamental part of a Maven project. The pom.xml file contains 
configuration information for Maven to build the project, manage dependencies, and execute various tasks during the build lifecycle. 
The POM file is typically located in the root directory of the project.
